Scale the 1-bit ALU into an 8-bit ripple-carry ALU, verify logic and arithmetic correctness, and ensure proper carry propagation across all slices.
---

üîß Development Process
Step	Task	Description / Result
- 	Built 8√ó 1-bit ALU slices	Duplicated the verified 1-bit ALU circuit into eight identical slices. Each slice contains its own full adder, logic gates (AND, OR, NOT), and multiplexer for result selection.
- 	Shared decoder control	A single 2‚Üí4 decoder was connected to all slices, distributing the same opcode signals (F1, F0). This ensures that every bit performs the same operation simultaneously.
- 	Carry-chain configuration	Connected Cout ‚Üí Cin sequentially from the least-significant bit (LSB) to the most-significant bit (MSB). The external carry-in was grounded (Cin‚ÇÄ = 0), and the final carry-out was observed from the MSB slice.
- 	Direction test	Initially, carry propagated in the wrong direction (MSB ‚Üí LSB). Rewired the chain to flow LSB ‚Üí MSB. Verified correct bit ordering by observing ‚Äúdomino zero‚Äù ripple effect with Y = 11111111.
- 	Logic verification	Confirmed that logic operations ignore carry and produce consistent results across all bits.
- 	Arithmetic verification	Confirmed correct addition and carry-out generation across all 8 bits. Ripple timing and sum bits were validated.
- 	Final testing	Performed full test suite (AND, OR, NOT, ADD). All results matched the expected truth tables.

Rebuild the ALU from scratch after design issues in the previous version.
---
Progress Summary:
Designed and implemented a 1-bit full adder using two half adders and an OR gate.
Verified the adder against the full truth table all outputs matched perfectly.
Built a 2‚Üí4 decoder using F1 and F0 inputs with NOT and AND gates to generate operation select lines.
Connected the decoder outputs to enable logic and arithmetic units.  
Implemented the logic unit supporting:

00 ‚Üí X AND Y  
01 ‚Üí X OR Y  
10 ‚Üí NOT X  
11 ‚Üí ADD X and Y (+ Cin)  

Constructed and tested the full ALU with all 16 test cases (logic + arithmetic).

All tests passed 1-to-1 correct Result and Cout for every operation.

Outcome:
The ALU is fully functional and validated. Decoder, logic unit, and full adder all operate correctly together.

Connected the decoder outputs to the logic unit and adder blocks.
Performed functional testing on the 1-bit ALU slice before chaining 8 bits.
Implemented output selection network:

(D0 ¬∑ AND_out) + (D1 ¬∑ OR_out) + (D2 ¬∑ NOT_out) + (D3 ¬∑ ADD_out)

Replaced incorrect XOR combiner with OR gate.
Traced and corrected multiple wiring mix-ups between decoder lines and logic functions.
Swapped D0/D1 enables to align 00 ‚Üí AND, 01 ‚Üí OR.
Discovered carry-out leakage from adder in logic modes ‚Üí gated Cout with D3.
Refined the NOT path to use pure ¬¨B signal, independent of A or Cin.
Built and verified 8-bit version: A[7:0], B[7:0] buses, carry chain, shared F1 F0 control.
