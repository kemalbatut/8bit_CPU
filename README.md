8-bit CPU Mainboard / ALU Module Testing
---
ðŸ”§ Work Done Today
Verified the 2-to-4 decoder design and corrected wiring.
Each combination of F1 F0 âˆˆ {00, 01, 10, 11} activates exactly one output (D0â€“D3).
Confirmed one-hot behavior with LED probes.
Connected the decoder outputs to the logic unit and adder blocks.
Performed functional testing on the 1-bit ALU slice before chaining 8 bits.
Implemented output selection network:

(D0 Â· AND_out) + (D1 Â· OR_out) + (D2 Â· NOT_out) + (D3 Â· ADD_out)

Replaced incorrect XOR combiner with OR gate.
Traced and corrected multiple wiring mix-ups between decoder lines and logic functions.
Swapped D0/D1 enables to align 00 â†’ AND, 01 â†’ OR.
Discovered carry-out leakage from adder in logic modes â†’ gated Cout with D3.
Refined the NOT path to use pure Â¬B signal, independent of A or Cin.
Built and verified 8-bit version: A[7:0], B[7:0] buses, carry chain, shared F1 F0 control.
